## Description

_\<* 3.23 -- you submit a file named `Heaviside.py`.
* 3.24 -- you submit a fle named `smoothed_Heaviside.py`

* 3.35 -- you submit a file named `count_pairs.py`

* 3.28 and 3.29 -- you do not need to submit anything, but these are valuable exercises for test prep.

### Histograms

Define `histogram()`, a procedure that takes a list of positive integers and prints a histogram. For example, `histogram([4, 9, 13, 5])` should print the following:

```
****
*********
*************
*****
```

### Length of an integer

Define a function `digits(n)` that calculates the number of digits (plus the sign for negative numbers) in an integer. For example `digits(521)` should return `3`; `digits(-4530)` should return `5`.

### Enhanced histogram

Using the `digits(n)` function you have written to improve the histogram procedure to print a title and the number of asterisks in each row. For example, `histogram("Data", [4, 9, 13, 5])` should print the following:

```
 n  | Data
---+------------------
 4 | ****
 9 | *********
13 | *************
 5 | *****
```\>_

## What I Learned from This

_\<I struggled to learn the concept of the histogram just because of the loops and the if statements until i got it somewhat understandably.\>_

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.
